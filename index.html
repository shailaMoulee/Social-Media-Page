          <h3>Memories</h3><br>
          <p>
            ...<br>Holding the tiny fingers of my daughters upon their births will forever remain a profound, life-changing experience. Those fragile fingers, seeking warmth and security, marked the beginning of an unbreakable bond. It's a moment of pure wonder and emotion, as I realized that I was entrusted with the responsibility of nurturing and guiding these tiny, precious life.<br>...

            <br>Collecting fallen mangoes during thunderstorms with cousins and the neighborhood children was a thrilling adventure. The thunder rumbled, and the rain poured, but it didn't deter our quest for those ripe, juicy mangoes. With laughter and excitement, the taste of those mangoes became sweeter by our shared efforts.<br>...

            <br>The white Vespa rides with my husband during rainy storms to cross hometowns are etched in my memory. The raindrops pelt against us, and the wind carries the scent of wet earth as we journey through familiar streets. It's an unspoken connection, a shared love for spontaneity and the thrill of nature's drama.<br>...
